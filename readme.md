This is a manual for my software. You can use the software to store any information privately. The default password is "1234" .Once you enter the password you will see that this text dissapears (if you are reading this from the software) and "1234" will be displayed. You can edit this "1234" for a more secure password that will keep all your information safe that you type in here. The next lines below can be used for whatever you want to keep safe be it your account passwords, PIN numbers, etc.

The first line is the password the next are for your private information.
